# Wine Quality

In this project, I'll be exploring the wine quality dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). This dataset contains several wine observations related to red and white winho verde wine samples, from the north of portugal. Note: Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical and sensory variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

For more information about this dataset, feel free to check out `winequality.names`, also located in this repository.
